# Small Molecule Drug Development Project

## Overview

This project is aimed at creating a classifcation predication model to identify small chemcial compounds that are potential inhibtiors of cancers caused by the BRAFV600E mutation, a mutation strongly assoicated with the onset of various forms of cancer, particulary melanoma. 

## Technical Details 

For this project, we have used an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier, which is useful for our project requirements where we have to categorize compounds based on the compounds likelihood of being an effective inhibitor for BRAF mutations.
