# Small Molecule Drug Development Project

## Overview

This project utulizes machine learning to identify potential small molecules capable of inhibiting BRAF protein mutations, a mutation that is significant precursor to various cancer forms, particularly melanoma. 

## Technical Details 

For this project, we have used an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier, which is useful for our project requirements where we have to categorize compounds based on the compounds likelihood of being an effective inhibitor for BRAF mutations.
